# TripleX
Hello, This is an open-source project that I have created using visual studio code and c++. This is an simple terminal game based in c++, you 
can edit this code and make it your own. its a very simple game you and your friends can play and edit. The game is played using numbers in your keyboard, 
you start your game in an converstation between the head of the FBI and an special secret hacker cum agent, after the conversation the game show you on how 
the instructions. To compile and run the code, you need visual studio code or visual studio communty, then copy-paste the file in the workplace and after that 
save it. The final step is to open your terminal and then compile and run the code. I hope you enjoy my project
